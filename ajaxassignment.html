<h2>Explanation of AJAX</h2>
<p>The loadDoc funciton creates an varible called xhttp storing a request to a server.
  Then a callback function when the data is loaded to the function myfunction(). After sends a request with the open method using  GET request
  from the xml file. Finally sends method to comeplete the request from the server.
</p>

<p>
  The function myFunction resolves the xml response retrieving data from the server. Inside the constant x is to get a list of all the CD elements.
  Inside the varible table is html table being created. After the table, a for loop iterates through each cd element in the list and extracts the artist and title
  information using the tagname and childnodes. Finally, the table variable is assigned to the innerhtml property.

<h2>Rest API</h2>
<p>Hello dev team,
<br>
I'm excited to present a weather API that has the potential to significantly enhance the value and capabilities of our
products: <a href = "https://apilist.fun/api/tomorrow.io-weather-ap">Tomorrow.io Weather API.</a>  This API offers unparalleled accuracy, granularity, 
and coverage, making it ideal for integrating weather-driven features and insights into our applications.
</p>

<p>Hyper-Accurate Data: Leverages a blend of traditional sources, new sensing technologies, and proprietary modeling to deliver best-in-class weather data, ensuring the most precise and reliable information for our users.
Global Coverage with High Resolution: Provides data for any location worldwide, with granularity down to minute-by-minute forecasts and hyperlocal observations. This level of detail is unmatched in the industry.
Extensive Data Layers: Offers over 80 data layers, covering everything from temperature and precipitation to lightning strikes and air quality, empowering us to create a diverse range of weather-centric features.
Frequent Updates: Forecasts are updated every 15 minutes, ensuring our applications always reflect the most current weather conditions.</p>
<p>
  Response Format: Data is delivered in JSON format, easily parsed and integrated into our existing codebase.
Authentication: Requires an API key for access, which can be obtained for free from Tomorrow.io.
Pricing: While a free plan is available, I recommend exploring paid plans for higher usage limits and access to premium features. These plans are typically charged based on API calls or data usage.
Documentation: Comprehensive developer documentation is available here: <a href ="https://docs.tomorrow.io/reference/welcome">Access Tomorrow.io API Documentation.</a>
</p>
<p>The Tomorrow.io Weather API presents a compelling opportunity to advance our product offerings and create distinctive value for our users. I strongly urge the development team to explore its capabilities and consider integration into our upcoming projects.
Feel free to reach out for further discussions or assistance as needed</p>
